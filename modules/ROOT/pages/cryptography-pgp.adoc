Mule can encrypt all or part of a message using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). PGP combines data compression and data encryption to secure messages. The compression reduces the size of the payload to help reduce the transmission time later on your application.

Due to its increased complexity, PGP encryption is a heavy-load task when compared to JCE or XML encryption.

This section addresses these scenarios:

* Encryption: Using another party's public key to encrypt an outgoing message in a Mule app.
* Decryption: Using your own private key to decrypt an incoming message in a Mule app.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are reasonably familiar with PGP encryption, as well as the concepts of public and private keys and asymmetric cryptography.

== Configure PGP Encryption from Anypoint Studio

To configure PGP encryption from Anypoint Studio, follow these steps:

. From the Mule palette, add *Crypto* to your project.
+
See xref:cryptography.adoc#install-crypto-module[Install the Extension] for instructions.
. Select the desired operation, and drag the component to the flow:
+
image::mruntime-crypto-pgp-add.png[crypto-pgp-add]
. Open the component properties and select an existing *Module configuration*, or create a new one by specifying the *Public keyring* file and the *Private keyring* file.
+
You can also add asymmetric key information to be used in the sign operations:
+
image::mruntime-crypto-pgp-global-config.png[crypto-pgp-global-config]
. Configure *Key selection* by using a *Key id* value previously defined in the module configuration, or define a new one for this operation:
+
image::mruntime-crypto-pgp-config.png[crypto-pgp-config]
. Select the algorithm to use during the operation.

== Working with Subkeys

A key can contain subkeys, according to the RFC-4880 standard specification. When working with subkeys, use the `fingerprint` attribute of the `<crypto:pgp-asymmetric-key-info>` element in the XML configuration to specify the key to use.

For example, if you use different keys for signing and encrypting operations, and each of these keys use different algorithms, like DSA and ElGamal, then you must reference the appropriate key's fingerprint, depending on the operation you want to perform.

In this case, you reference the ElGamal fingerprint to encrypt your messages and the DSA fingerprint to sign your messages.

== Encrypting Messages with Public Keys

During PGP encryption, the sender of the message must encrypt its content using the receiver's public key. So, whenever you want to encrypt messages in your Mule app using someone else's public key, you must add the public key to your key ring. When adding a new PGP configuration to your Mule app, you need to provide your key ring file so the encryption module can get the public key from it to encrypt the message.

. Use a tool such as GPG Suite to import the other party's public key. See below for details.
. Using the same tool, export the public key, selecting `binary` as the output format. This produces a key ring file with a `.gpg` extension.
. Ensure that the key ring (`.gpg`) file is stored where the Mule app can access it during runtime.

.Example: PGP Configuration
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<crypto:pgp-config name="encrypt-conf" publicKeyring="pgp/pubring.gpg">
    <crypto:pgp-key-infos>
        <crypto:pgp-asymmetric-key-info keyId="myself" fingerprint="DE3F10F1B6B7F221"/>
    </crypto:pgp-key-infos>
</crypto:pgp-config>
----

* Using the Encrypt Operation
+
The next example returns an ASCII-armored encrypted payload, which is suitable for sending over plain-text channels:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<crypto:pgp-encrypt config-ref="encrypt-conf" keyId="myself"/>
----

* Using the Encrypt Binary Operation
+
If you want to return a binary output instead, you can use the `pgp-encrypt-binary` operation:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<crypto:pgp-encrypt-binary config-ref="pgp-conf" keyId="recipient"/>
----
+
Producing a binary output is faster than using ASCII-armored. However, the output is not standard and might not be ideal to send to other systems for decryption.

* Using the Binary to Armored Operation
+
If you need to send a payload with binary output to another system, you can transform it to ASCII-armored:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<crypto:pgp-binary-to-armored/>
----
This operation has a single input parameter, the message payload to transform.

== Encrypt and Sign

In addition to encrypting, you can atomically encrypt and sign a message, which returns a message (in ASCII-armored format) similar to the encrypted one. In this case, the returned message also has a signature inside its encrypted contents. The signature provides an integrity check of the original message.

To encrypt and sign, the signer private key (which is usually the sender) must be in the public key ring. This process always produces an ASCII-armored output.

.Example: PGP Configuration
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<crypto:pgp-encrypt-and-sign config-ref="encrypt-conf">
    <crypto:encryption-key-selection keyId="recipient-key-id" />
    <crypto:sign-key-selection keyId="signer-key-id" />
</crypto:pgp-encrypt-and-sign>
----

== Decrypt

During PGP decryption, the receiver of the message must use its private key to decrypt the contents of a message that was encrypted using a public key.
Therefore, the receiver must distribute its public key to those who will use it to send encrypted messages.

.Example: PGP Configuration
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<crypto:pgp-config name="decrypt-conf" privateKeyring="pgp/secring.gpg">
    <crypto:pgp-key-infos>
        <crypto:pgp-asymmetric-key-info keyId="myself" fingerprint="DE3F10F1B6B7F221" passphrase="mule1234"/>
    </crypto:pgp-key-infos>
</crypto:pgp-config>
----
In the example above, notice that you need to provide at least three parameters to be able to use the private key ring in the decrypt operation:

* Key ID (`keyId`): the internal ID that will allow you to reference this key from an operation.
* Key Fingerprint (`fingerprint`): The last 16 characters of your key fingerprint, which can be obtained from your external GPG tool (such as GPG Keychain).
* Passphrase (`passphrase`): The passphrase of the private key.

.Example: Using the Decrypt Operation
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<crypto:pgp-decrypt config-ref="decrypt-conf"/>
----

== Signing

Sign a message using a configured private key.

.Example: PGP Configuration
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<crypto:pgp-config name="sign-conf" privateKeyring="pgp/secring.gpg">
    <crypto:pgp-key-infos>
        <crypto:pgp-asymmetric-key-info keyId="myself" fingerprint="DE3F10F1B6B7F221" passphrase="mule1234"/>
    </crypto:pgp-key-infos>
</crypto:pgp-config>
----

.Example: Using the Sign Operation
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<crypto:pgp-sign config-ref="sign-conf" keyId="myself"/>
----

== Validating a Signature

Validate the signature of a message using the signer's public key.

.Example: PGP Configuration
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<crypto:pgp-config name="validate-conf" publicKeyring="pgp/pubring.gpg">
    <crypto:pgp-key-infos>
        <crypto:pgp-asymmetric-key-info keyId="signer" fingerprint="DE3F10F1B6B7F221"/>
    </crypto:pgp-key-infos>
</crypto:pgp-config>
----

.Example: Using the Validate Operation
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<crypto:pgp-validate config-ref="validate-conf" value="#[payload]" expected="#[vars.expected]"/>
----
