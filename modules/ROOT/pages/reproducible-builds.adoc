Being able to build a particular version of your Mule project at any time facilitates maintenance, because the versions of your projects in production are not always the latest ones.


To help achieve this goal:

* Use source control for all your Mule projects and apply branching, merging, and tagging to them. +
Do not check in Eclipse-specific files. +
See https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2[Git Source Control] documentation for details.
* Manage dependencies strictly by using Apache Maven and an in-house repository manager, such as Nexus. +
See xref:using-maven-with-mule.adoc[Maven Support in Mule] documentation for guidelines.
