When processing large files through DataWeave in Mule runtime engine, there are a few things you can set up to fine-tune how much memory will be used and when.

[[buffersize]]

== RAM vs Disk Usage

DataWeave uses disk data storage to avoid running out of memory. The files created are placed in a default temporary directory. If you want to store those files in a custom directory instead, you can specify the directory by using the `java.io.tmpdir` property.

Two types of DataWeave files are generated, both with names beginning with `dw-buffer-`: +

* `dw-buffer-output-${count}.tmp` +
Used to store the output of a transformation when the result is bigger than the threshold *1572864 bytes*.
To change this threshold value, add the system property `com.mulesoft.dw.buffersize` and assign it the number of bytes you want as your new threshold. Because you can define system properties in several ways, see xref:configuring-properties.adoc#system-properties[system properties] for further details.
Mule runtime engine deletes the file when the value is no longer referenced, JVM GC collects it or when the Mule Event finishes executing.

* `dw-buffer-index-${count}.tmp` +
Used to store index information of a value being read. This file helps DataWeave access data quickly. Mule runtime engine deletes the file when the execution of the transformation ends or, in a streaming use case like the foreach loop, when the stream ends (when foreach finishes its execution).

* `com.mulesoft.dw.directbuffer.disable` +
Introduced in Mule 4.2.2, this option controls whether DataWeave uses off-heap memory (the default) or heap memory. DataWeave uses off-heap memory for internal buffering. However, this setting can cause problems on machines that have only a small amount of memory.
