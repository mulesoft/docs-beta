= Tree (dw::util::Tree)

This utility module provides functions that enable you to handle values
as though they are tree data structures.

The module is included with Mule runtime. To use it, you must import it into
your DataWeave code, for example, by adding the line
`import * from dw::util::Tree` to the header of your script.

_Introduced in DataWeave 2.2.2. Supported by Mule 4.2.2 and later._
