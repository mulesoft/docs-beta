DataWeave represents data using values, each of which has a data type associated with it. There are many types, such as strings, arrays, Booleans, numbers, objects, dates, times, and others. Each type supports several ways of creating its values. This topic explores many of the ways you can create them.
//LINK TO DW 1.0 LANDING PAGE IN MULE 3.9 DOCS:
include::partial$dataweave1-links.adoc[tag=dataweave1LandingPage]


The types that DataWeave provide are bundled into modules that also contain the related functions.

Types in the `dw::Core` module (Core types) are available without having to import the Core module. Other modules need to be imported for their functions and types to be available.

It is important for you to know the values that are possible for each DataWeave type, how to create those values, and the common patterns used:

* Conditional elements that use `if` expressions for <<conditional_elements_array, arrays>> and <<conditional_elements_object, objects>>.
* <<string_interpolation>>
* <<date_decomposition>> for accessing different parts of a date
* <<date_format_change>>
* <<dynamic_keys>> and <<dynamic_elements>>, which allow you to access parts of an object dynamically
* Use of <<dw_type_regex>> expressions

[[dw_type_array]]
== Array (dw::Core Type)

An array can hold elements of any supported type. Here is an example of an array:

.Example: DataWeave Array
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
var x = "words"
---
[ "My", "three", x ]
----

[[conditional_elements_array]]
=== Conditional Elements

Arrays can define elements that appear (or not) based on a condition.

Conditional elements take the form `(value) if condition`, for example:

.Example: if Condition
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
[(1) if true, (2) if false]
----

.Output
[source,json,linenums]
----
[1]
----

[[dw_type_boolean]]
== Boolean (dw::Core Type)

A `Boolean` is defined by the keywords `true` and `false`.

[[dw_type_cdata]]
== CData (dw::Core Type)

XML defines a custom type named `CData`, which inherits from and extends `String`. It is used to identify a CDATA XML block. It can be used to tell the writer to wrap the content inside CDATA or to check if the input string arrives inside a CDATA block.

.Transform

  users:
  {
    user : "Mariano" as CData,
    age : 31 as CData
  }
}
----

.Output

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<users>
  <user><![CDATA[Mariano]]></user>
  <age><![CDATA[31]]></age>
</users>
----


[[dw_type_dates]]
== Date and Time (dw::Core Types)

Dates in DataWeave follow the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html[ISO-8601 standard] and literals are defined between `|` characters.

The language has the following native date types:

* `Date`
* `DateTime`
* `LocalDateTime`
* `LocalTime`
* `Period`
* `Time`
* `TimeZone`

[[dw_type_dates_date]]
=== Date

A `Date` represented by `Year`, `Month`, and `Day`, specified as `|yyyy-MM-dd|`. The `Date` type has no time component.

.Example
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
|2003-10-01|
----

[[dw_type_dates_datetime]]
=== DateTime

A Date and Time within a TimeZone. It is the conjunction of `Date` + `Time` + `TimeZone`.

.Example
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
|2003-10-01T23:57:59-03:00|
----

=== LocalDateTime

A `DateTime` in the current `TimeZone`.

.Example
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
|2003-10-01T23:57:59|
----

[[dw_type_dates_localtime]]
=== LocalTime

A `Time` in the current `TimeZone`.

[[dw_type_dates_period]]
=== Period

`Period` represents an amount of time. The type takes the following form:

- `P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S`
- `P<date>T<time>``

Where the [n] is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that follow the [n].

`Period` has two subcategories:

* `DatePeriod` +
 A date-based amount of time, for example, 1 year, 2 months, 3 days. Because these expressions are date-based, they cannot be converted to milliseconds. For example, a month does not specify whether it is a month of 31 days or not, nor does a year specify whether it is a leap year. The data expresses just an amount of date. In DataWeave, the syntax is `|P1Y|`.

* `Duration` +
A time-based amount of time, for example, 1 second, 2 hours, or 2 days, each of which can be represented in seconds or milliseconds. In DataWeave, the syntax is `|PT1H|`.

`P` is the duration designator placed at the start of the duration representation.

- `Y` is the year designator (e.g. `|P1Y|`)
- `M` is the month designator (e.g. `|P1M|`)
- `D` is the day designator (e.g. `|P1D|`)

`T` is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.

- `H` is the hour designator (e.g. `|PT1H|`)
- `M` is the minute designator (e.g. `|PT1M|`)
- `S` is the second designator (e.g. `|PT1S|`)

`DatePeriod` is useful for date manipulation, such as addition or subtraction. +
The following example shows how to subtract one year from a date using `DatePeriod`. The return type is a new `Date` value:

.Source
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
output application/dw
---
|2003-10-01| - |P1Y|
----

.Output
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
|2002-10-01|
----

`Duration` is useful as a result of a `Date` to `Date` subtraction so the amount of time between those two dates can be inferred. +
The following example shows how subtracting one `Date` value from another returns a `Duration` value:

.Source
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
output application/dw
---
|2003-11-01| - |2003-10-01|
----

.Output
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
|PT744H|
----

==== Period Coercion

Because a `DatePeriod` value is date-based, it can be coerced to `Number` date-based units, such as `years` or `months`. +
The following example shows how to coerce a `DatePeriod` value to a `Number` value by using different units:

.Source
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
output application/json
---
{
 years:  |P1Y12M| as Number {unit: "years"},
 months: |P8Y12M| as Number {unit: "months"}
}
----

.Output
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "years": 2,
  "months": 108
}
----

==== Duration Coercion

Because `Duration` is time-based, this type can be coerced to a `Number` with different time-based units, such as `nanos`, `milliseconds`, `seconds`, `hours`, and `days`.

The following example shows how to coerce a `Duration` to a `Number` by using different units:

.Source
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
output application/json
var period = (|2010-12-10T12:10:12| - |2010-09-09T10:02:10|)
---
{
 nanos: period as Number {unit: "nanos"},
 millis: period as Number {unit: "milliseconds"},
 seconds: period as Number {unit: "seconds"},
 hours: period as Number {unit: "hours"},
 days: period as Number {unit: "days"}
}
----

.Output
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "nanos": 7956482000000000,
  "millis": 7956482000,
  "seconds": 7956482,
  "hours": 2210,
  "days": 92
}
----

==== Deconstruct

A `Duration` can be deconstructed into `hours`, `minutes` and `secs`.

The following example shows how to deconstruct a `Duration` value:

.Source
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
var period = (|2010-12-10T12:10:12| - |2010-12-10T10:02:10|)
---
{
   hours:  period.hours,
   minutes:  period.minutes,
   secs:  period.secs,
}
----

.Output
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "hours": 2,
  "minutes": 8,
  "secs": 2
}
----



[[dw_type_dates_time]]
=== Time

A time in a specific `TimeZone`, specified as `|HH:mm:ss.SSS|`.

.Example
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
|23:59:56|
----

[[dw_type_dates_timezone]]
=== TimeZone

The `Time` relative to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). A `TimeZone` must include a `+` or a `-`. For example, `|03:00|` is a time, while `|+03:00|` is a `TimeZone`.

.Example
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
|-08:00|
----

[[date_decomposition]]
=== Date Decomposition

To access the different parts of the date, special selectors must be used.

.Transform
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
var myDate = |2003-10-01T23:57:59.700-03:00|
---
{
  year: myDate.year,
  month: myDate.month,
  day: myDate.day,
  hour: myDate.hour,
  minutes: myDate.minutes,
  seconds: myDate.seconds,
  milliseconds: myDate.milliseconds,
  nanoseconds: myDate.nanoseconds,
  quarter: myDate.quarter,
  dayOfWeek: myDate.dayOfWeek,
  dayOfYear: myDate.dayOfYear,
  offsetSeconds: myDate.offsetSeconds
}
----

.Output
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "year": 2003,
  "month": 10,
  "day": 1,
  "hour": 23,
  "minutes": 57,
  "seconds": 59,
  "milliseconds": 700,
  "nanoseconds": 700000000,
  "quarter": 4,
  "dayOfWeek": 3,
  "dayOfYear": 274,
  "offsetSeconds": -10800
}
----

[[date_format_change]]
=== Changing the Format of a Date


To format dates and times, DataWeave supports some formatting characters
that are based on the Java 8 `java.time.format` package, such as the `y`, `M`,
and `d` in the date format `yyyy-MM-dd`. The following example formats
the output of the `now` DataWeave function to show supported letters:

You can combine the formatting letters to write supported date an time formats into a string,
using `as` in the following way:

.Transform

----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
formattedDate: |2003-10-01T23:57:59| as String {format: "yyyy-MM-dd"}
----

.Output
[source,json,linenums]
----
{ "formattedDate": "2003-10-01" }
----

For multiple, similar conversions in your script, you might want
to define a custom type as a directive in the header and set each
date to that type.

.Transform
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json

  formattedDate2: |2015-07-06T08:53:15| as Mydate
}
----

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "formattedDate1": "2003/10/01",
  "formattedDate2": "2015/07/06"
}
----

Note that type names are case-sensitive.

[[dw_type_enum]]
== Enum (dw::Core Type)

This type is based on the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Enum.html[Enum Java class].
It must always be used with the `class` property, specifying the full Java class name of the class, as shown in this example.

.Transform
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/java
---
"Male" as Enum {class: "com.acme.GenderEnum"}
----

[[dw_type_iterator]]
== Iterator (dw::Core Type)

The `Iterator` type is based on the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html[Iterator Java class], that iterates through arrays. `Iterator` contains a collection and includes methods to iterate through and filter it.

Note that like the Java class, the iterator is designed to be consumed only once. For example, if a logger consumes the value, the value is no longer readable by subsequent elements in the flow.

[[dw_type_null]]
== Null (dw::Core Type)

DataWeave defines a `Null` data type for `null` values. It is important to note that `null`
is the value, while `Null` is the type. DataWeave functions do not recognize `Null` as
a `null` value.

You can determine whether a DataWeave function accepts `null` values by
looking in the DataWeave reference documentation for a function signature
that accepts a Null type. For example, the
xref:dw-core-functions-flatten.adoc#flatten2[flatten] function has two function
signatures, one of which is `flatten(Null): Null`. The signature indicates that
`flatten` can accept `null` values. The xref:dw-core-functions-plusplus.adoc[++]
(concatenate) function, which lacks a signature for handling value so the `Null`
type, does not accept `null`.

* `flatten([[1],2,[null],null])` returns `[1,2,null,null]`
* `"a" &#43;&#43; null` returns the error
`Unable to call &#96;&#43;&#43;&#96; with (&#96;String&#96;, &#96;Null&#96;)`.


[[dw_type_number]]
== Number (dw::Core Type)

There is only one Number type that supports both floating point and integer numbers. There is no loss of precision in any operation, the engine always stores the data in the most performant way that does not compromise precision.

[[dw_type_object]]
== Object (dw::Core Type)

Represents any object as a collection of `Key:value` pairs, where a `Key` is
composed of a `Name` and `Attributes`.

The `Name` type is composed of a `String` as the local name and the `Namespace`.
`Attributes` is composed of an Array of `Name:value` pairs. Note that the `Key`
is not a `String`, so it is not possible to compare keys. However, you can get
the local name by performing an `as String` type coercion on any value of type
`Key`.

.Example

[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
{
  name: "Annie"
}
----

=== Single Value Objects

If an Object has only one `key:value` pair, the enclosing curly brackets `{ }` are not required:

.Example

[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
name: "Annie"
----

[[conditional_elements_object]]
=== Conditional Elements

Objects can define conditional key-value pairs based on a conditional expression. Conditional elements have the form `(key:value) if` condition.

[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/xml encoding="UTF-8"
---
file: {
  name: "transform",
  (extension: "zip") if payload.fileSystem?

----

This example outputs an additional field called "extension" only when the fileSystem property is present in payload (this field may contain any value, not just `true`).

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<file>
  <name>transform</name>
  <extension>zip</extension>
</file>
----

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

----

[[dynamic_keys]]
=== Dynamic Keys

To specify a key through an expression, you need to wrap the expression in parentheses.

.Transform
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
var dynamicKey = "language"
---
{
  (dynamicKey): "Data Weave"
}
----

.Output
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "language": "Data Weave"

----

[[dynamic_elements]]
=== Dynamic Elements

Dynamic elements allow you to add the result of an expression as `key:value` pairs of an object. That expression must be either an `object` or an `array of objects`.

.Transform
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
var x = [
  {b: "b"},
  {c: "c", d: "d"}
]
var y = {e: "e"}
---
{
  a: "a",
  (x),
  (y)
}
----

It is important to note that the expression between the _parentheses_ (such as `(x)` where `x` is the variable shown in the header) should return an array of objects. All of objects in that array get merged together. They are also merged with the contained object. So the output looks like this:

.Output
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "a": "a",
  "b": "b",
  "c": "c",
  "d": "d",
  "e": "e"

----

=== Conditional XML Attributes

You might want your output to only include certain XML attributes based on a condition. Conditional elements have the form `(key:value) if condition`

.Transform
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/xml
---
{
  name @(
    (company: "Acme") if false,
    (transform: "Anything") if true

}
----

.Output
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='US-ASCII'?>
<name transform="Anything">DataWeave</name>
----

=== Dynamic XML Attributes

You might want to include a changing set of key:value pairs in a specific location as XML attributes.

[[dw_type_regex]]
== Regex (dw::Core Type)

Regular Expressions are defined between `/`. For example `/\d+/` represents multiple numerical digits from 0-9. These may be used as arguments in certain operations that act upon strings, like Matches or Replace, or on operations that act upon objects and arrays, such as filters.

[[dw_type_string]]
== String (dw::Core Type)

A string can be defined by the use of double quotes or single quotes.

{
  doubleQuoted: "Hello",
  singleQuoted: 'Hello',
}

[[escape-chars-string]]
=== Escaping Special Characters

Use the backslash (`\`) to escape special characters in an input string:

* `$`: You need to escape any use of of `$` in a string. Otherwise, DataWeave
treats the `$` as an unnamed parameter for a function and returns the error
`Unable to resolve reference of $.`.
* `"`: For a string that is surrounded by double quotes, you need to escape any
double quote that is part of the string, for example, `"a\"bcdef"`. Here, the
second double-quote is part of the string that starts with an `a` and ends
with `f`.
* `'` For a string that is surrounded by single quotes, you need to escape any
single quote that is part of the string: for example, `+'abcd\'e"f'+`. In this example, the
second single quote is part of the string that starts with an `a` and ends
with `f`. Notice that you do not need to escape the double quote in this case.
* `\``: For a string that is surrounded by backticks (supported in DataWeave 2.0), you must escape any backtick that is part of the string: for example, ``abc\`def``.
* `\`: Because the backslash is the character you use to escape other special
characters, you need to escape it with a separate backslash to use it in
a string, for example,`\\`.
* `\n`: For inserting a new line.
* `\t`: For inserting a tab.
* `\u`: For inserting a unicode character, such as `\u25c4`.

[[string_interpolation]]
=== String Interpolation

String interpolation allows you to embed variables or expressions directly in a string. The expression need to be enclosed (`$( <expression> )`), and it should always return String type or something that is coercible to String.

[[dw_type_tryresult]]
== TryResult (dw::Runtime Type)

Evaluates the delegate and returns an object with the result or an error message. See the `try` example. A successful `TryResult` contains the `result` field and a `success` value of `true`. An unsuccessful `TryResult` contains the `error` field  and a `success` value of `false`.

{
  success: Boolean,

[[dw_type_url]]
== URI Types (dw::core::URL)

Functions in the URI function module can return a URI data type.

.Definition:
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
{
  isValid: Boolean,
  host?: String,
  authority?: String,
  fragment?: String,
  path?: String,
  port?: Number,
  query?: String,
  scheme?: String,
  user?: String,
  isAbsolute?: Boolean,
  isOpaque?: Boolean
}
----

The URI type consists of the following fields:

* `isValid`: Boolean that indicates whether the URI is valid. Invalid characters
   include `&lt;`, `&gt;`, and blank spaces.
* `host`: String representing the host name (for example,
  `+my.company.com+` from `+http://my.company.com:8080/hello+`)
* `authority`: String representing the authority, which includes the host
   and port (for example, `+my.company.com:8080+` from
  `+http://my.company.com:8080/hello+`). Returns the port only if it is
  explicitly specified in the URI.
* `fragment`: String representing the subordinate resource after the `#` in
              the URI (for example, `footer` in the URI
              `+"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#footer"+`).
* `path`: String representing a path following the host or authority (for example,
          `/hello` in `+http://my.company.com:8080/hello+`) .
* `port`: Number representing an explicit port in the URI (for example, `8080`
          in `+http://my.company.com:8080/hello+`). If no port is specified
          (for example, `+http://my.company.com/hello+`), the value of the
          `port` field is `null`.
* `query`: String identifying a query portion of a URI (for example,
           `field=value` in '+http://my.company.com:1234/hello/?field=value+').
* `scheme`: String identifying the URI scheme, such as `https` or `http`,
            which appears before a colon (`:`).
* `user`: String representing user information in a URI (for example, the
          `myname` in `+http://myname@www.mycompany.com+`).
* `isAbsolute`: Boolean value of `true` if the URI contains a scheme,
                `false` if the URI does not (for example, a relative URI such as
                `/path/to/somewhere`).
* `isOpaque`: Boolean value of `true` if the URI lacks a scheme followed by
              forward slashes (`/`).
              `+mailto:somebody@somewhere.com+` returns `true`.

The following DataWeave script uses the `parseURI` function to return and
access values to fields from a URI type. Note that fields with `null`
values (for example, the URI defined by `uriDataTypeEx`) are not returned
unless you explicitly select them.

    'myQueryStringsEx': parseURI(queryStringsEx).query,
    // uriDataTypeEx lacks a query string:
    'myQueryStringNullEx': parseURI(uriDataTypeEx).query,
    // The URI includes the port number:
    'myAuthorityEx': parseURI('http://localhost:8080/test').authority
}
