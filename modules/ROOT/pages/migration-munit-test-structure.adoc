The MUnit test is divided into three scopes. All of them are optional:

[%header,cols="20,80"]
|===
|Scope |Description

| Behavior
| The behavior scope (`<munit:behavior/>`) is intended for setting the preconditions before executing the test logic. +
Mocks and Spies go in this section.

| Execution
| The execution scope is meant to have the testing logic which will wait for all processes to finish before executing the next scope.

| Validation
| The validation scope is meant to have all the validations regarding the result of the execution scope. +
Assertions and Verifications go in the validation scope.
|===

The following examples compare MUnit tests in 1.x to 2.x.
.Test in MUnit 1.x
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test name="sampleTest" description="Test">
    <flow-ref name="sampleFlow"/>
</munit:test>
----

.Test in MUnit 2.x
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test name="sampleTest" description="Test">
    <munit:execution >
        <flow-ref name="sampleFlow"/>
    </munit:execution>
</munit:test>
