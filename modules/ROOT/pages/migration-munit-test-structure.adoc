The MUnit test is divided into three scopes. All of them are optional:

[%header,cols="20,80"]
|===
|Scope |Description

| Behavior
| The behavior scope is meant to set all the preconditions before executing the test logic. +
Mocks and Spies should go in this section.

| Execution
| The execution scope is meant to have the testing logic which will wait for all processes to finish before executing the next scope.

| Validation
| The validation scope is meant to have all the validations regarding the result of the execution scope. +
Assertions and Verifications should go here.
