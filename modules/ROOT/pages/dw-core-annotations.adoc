| Annotation | Definition | Description

| AnnotationTarget
| `@AnnotationTarget(targets: Array<String>)`
| Defines where the Annotation can be used. If not defined, it can be used in any possible target.


Options are:

* Parameter: For function parameters.
* Function: For function definitions.
* Variable: For variable definitions.
* Import: For import definitions.


| DesignOnlyType
| `@DesignOnlyType()`
| Annotation that marks a parameter type as Design Only. This means that this
field type is only validated at design time. At runtime, only minimal
type validation takes place. This is useful for performance reasons,
especially with complex Object types.


| Lazy
| `@Lazy()`
| Annotation that marks a Variable declaration to be Lazily initialized.


_Introduced in DataWeave 2.3.0. Supported by Mule 4.3 and later._


| RuntimePermissions
| `@RuntimePermissions(permissions: Array<String>)`
| Annotation to specify that a function needs a given set of Runtime Permissions to be executed


| Since
| `@Since(version: String)`
| Annotation used to define the version from which this functionality is available.


_Introduced in DataWeave 2.3.0. Supported by Mule 4.3 and later._


| StreamCapable
| `@StreamCapable()`
| Annotation that marks a parameter as Stream capable. This means that this
field is going to consume the Array of Object in a forward only manner.


| TailRec
| `@TailRec()`
| Annotation that marks a function to be Tail Recursive. If the function is not
tail recursive, it will start failing.
