Mule 4 expedites development of integration apps with up to 50% fewer steps and
concepts to learn than Mule 3, including:

* a simplified language for connectivity
* clear access to data
* automatic tuning
* easier upgrade processes

For your existing Mule 3 applications to take advantage of these and other benefits, you can migrate your apps to Mule through one of these processes:

* A fully manual migration
* A partially automated migration with the Mule Migration Assistant (MMA), which
is available as an open source project on https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-migration-assistant[GitHub].

Both migration scenarios require the same xref:migration-prep.adoc[preparation].

A benefit of using MMA is that it automates part of the migration of Mule 3 apps to Mule 4. Though the MMA does not migrate the app entirely, it provides significant help with these tasks:

* Migrating the project structure.
* Automatically creating descriptor files, such as pom.xml or mule-artifact.json.
* Automatically performing many adaptations of the appâ€™s code.
* Providing guidance on how to manually migrate components and patterns that cannot be migrated automatically.

MMA helps with such tasks, but it is not to be expected to deliver a fully functional app. Some additional steps are required. Those steps include testing and can also include:

* Manual migration of unsupported components.
* Manual migration of complex MEL expressions to DataWeave that cannot be automatically converted by MMA.
* Manual migration of complex DataWeave transformations that cannot be automatically converted by MMA.
* Prior migration of the DataMapper with the DataWeave Migration tool, before running the MMA.

It is also important to note that the MMA does not support incremental migrations.
