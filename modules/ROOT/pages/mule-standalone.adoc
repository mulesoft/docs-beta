If you want to host Mule runtime engine in your own environment, first xref:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[verify that you meet all hardware and software requirements], and then xref:runtime-installation-task.adoc[download and install Mule].

You don't need to install Mule in the following scenarios:

* When you use Anypoint Studio (which contains Mule) for development and testing
* When you deploy applications to CloudHub or Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

After your installation of Mule is complete, xref:installing-an-enterprise-license.adoc[install an enterprise license] to enable all capabilities of Mule runtime engine.
