== Performing a Proxy Migration

To perform a proxy migration, this example uses the Mule Migration Assistant
(MMA). 
//TODO for GA: We'll link out to this page so people can download MMA if they need to:
// xref:migration-tutorial.adoc#prereqs[Prerequisites].

The MMA command for migrating proxies uses the standard
xref:migration-tool-procedure.adoc#options[command-line options] for migrating
a Mule app:

.Command-line Invocation:
[source,console,linenums]
----
$ java -jar mule-migration-assistant-runner-0.5.1.jar \
 -projectBasePath /Users/me/AnypointStudio/workspace-studio/my-mule3-proxy/ \
 -muleVersion 4.1.5 \
 -destinationProjectBasePath /Users/me/my-dir/my-migrated-proxy
----

Note that the MMA creates the directory for the migrated project through
the `-destinationProjectBasePath` option. The  `my-migrated-proxy` must _not_
exist before you invoke the command. If you point to a folder that exists
already, the migration will fail an error like this:
`Exception: Destination folder already exists.`

When the migrator runs successfully, you see a message something like this:

.Successful Migration
[source,console,linenums]
----
Executing migration...
...
========================================================
MIGRATION SUCCESS
========================================================
Total time: 11.335 s
Migration report:
/Users/me/my-dir/my-migrated-proxy/report/summary.html
----

After migration completes successfully, the destination folder contains:

* A proxy POM file.
* The `report` directory containing the
xref:migration-report.adoc[Mule Migration Report] (`summary.html`).
Note that the same information provided in the report can be found as comments
in the proxy XML file.
* The `mule-artifact.json` file, with a `minMuleVersion` value that matches the
`-muleVersion` value set in the MMA command.
* The `src` directory, which contains the migrated content.

The `src` directory contains subdirectories `main` and `test`. Inside `main`, the `mule` directory
is the proxy XML file. At the same level as the `mule` directory, MMA will create a
`resources` directory for any DataWeave files or other files that the migrated proxy needs.
Note that the configuration file defined in the proxy XML must be present in the `resources` directory
for the artifact to be deployed correctly. The `test` directory contains test configuration files.

After a successful migration, you need to modify the POM file as explained in
<<pom_migration>>. Once the POM file has the correct organization ID, you can
compile with `mvn clean install`. If the compilation is successful, you can
upload the migrated proxy to Exchange using `maven clean deploy`. You can find
a more detailed explanation of uploading a custom app in
xref:https://docs.mulesoft.com/exchange/to-publish-assets-maven[Publish and Deploy Exchange Assets Using Maven].

[[pom_migration]]
=== POM Migration

The POM file migration modifies the file to include the elements necessary for
uploading the custom proxy to Exchange:

* `{orgId}` must be replaced both in `<groupId>`
* `<exchange.url>` with the organization ID found in Anypoint Platform.
+
For more information on how to obtain the organization ID, see
xref:api-manager::custom-policy-uploading-to-exchange.adoc[Uploading a Custom Policy to Exchange].

By default, the Exchange URL is set to the production environment.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<groupId>{orgId}</groupId>

<properties>
 <exchange.url>https://maven.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/maven</exchange.url>
</properties>
----

Note that for the EU version of the URL, you need to set the URL manually
after the migration:

* URL template for EU:
`+https://maven.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/maven+`

If the MMA does not find a POM file for the proxy, MMA will create a new POM
file. In this file, the `artifactId` for the proxy is the name of the
base directory for the proxy app. For example, for a proxy in
`mytestproxy/src/main/app/proxy.xml`, the `artifactId` is `mytestproxy`.

[[dependency_and_plugin_versions]]
=== Dependency and Plugin Versions

Dependency and plugin versions are set by default by the MMA, and you can change
them manually, as needed.

[[not_migrated_elements]]
=== Un-Migrated Elements

Several elements are not migrated from Mule 3 to Mule 4:

[cols="2,5",options="header"]
|===
|Element                    | Reason

| `api-platform-gw:tags`        | API auto-create is disabled in Mule 4.
| `api-platform-gw:description` | API auto-create is disabled in Mule 4.

|===

For each of these elements, the child elements are removed, as well.

[[common_migration_issues]]
=== Common Migration Issues

If proxy files are not found during the migration, the MMA prints a message
like this one:

.Unsuccessful Migration
[source,console,linenums]
----
Executing migration...
...
===============================================================================
MIGRATION FAILED

[[pom_migration_issues]]
=== POM Migration Issues

If the MMA does not find the POM model for the proxy, the MMA will
either generate the model from an existing POM in Mule 3, or if there is no
Mule 3 POM, the MMA will create the model. If MMA uses an existing POM, any
incorrect POM definition that the MMA encounters will cause POM model creation
process to fail. For information about a POM model failure, you need to
check for any preceding error messages regarding MMA steps on modifying the
POM model.

[[raml_proxy_migration]]
=== RAML Proxy Migration

Currently, RAML proxy migration is not supported.

=== REST Proxy Migration

Currently, REST proxy migration is not supported.

[[wsdl_proxy_migration]]
=== WSDL Proxy Migration

Currently, WSDL proxy migration is not supported.
