= Fixed Width Format

MIME Type: `application/flatfile`

ID: `flatfile`

Fixed width types are technically considered a type of Flat File format, but
when selecting this option, the Transform component offers you settings that are
better tailored to the needs of this format.

NOTE: Fixed width in DataWeave supports files of up to 15 MB, and the memory requirement is roughly 40 to 1. For example, a 1-MB file requires up to 40 MB of memory to process, so it's important to consider this memory requirement in conjunction with your TPS needs for large fixed width files. This is not an exact figure; the value might vary according to the complexity of the mapping instructions.
