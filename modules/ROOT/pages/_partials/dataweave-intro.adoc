DataWeave is the MuleSoft expression language for accessing and transforming
data that travels through a Mule app. DataWeave is tightly integrated with the
Mule runtime engine, which runs the scripts and expressions in your Mule app.


DataWeave scripts act on data in the Mule event. Most commonly, you use it to
access and transform data in the message payload. For example, after a component
in your app retrieves data from one system, you can use DataWeave to modify and
output selected fields in that data to a new data format, then use another
component in your app to pass on that data to another system.
