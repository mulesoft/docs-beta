= Deploy Applications to Runtime Fabric
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

In addition to using Anypoint Runtime Manager, to deploy applications to Anypoint Runtime Fabric, you can also deploy applications by using the Mule Maven plugin. To do so, you must meet certain prerequisites, and configure your Runtime Fabric deployment strategy in your project's `pom.xml` file.

== Prerequisites

* Ensure that the Mule Maven Plugin is added to your project
+
See xref:mmp-concept.adoc#add-mmp[Add the Mule Maven Plugin to a Mule Project] for instructions.
* You understand and have available the number of resources required to deploy to Runtime Fabric +
See xref:runtime-fabric::deploy-resource-allocation.adoc[Resource Allocation on Anypoint Runtime Fabric] for more information.
* The application is already published in Exchange +
** To do this from Studio, see xref:studio::export-to-exchange-task.adoc[Publishing a Project to Exchange]. +
** To do this using Maven, see xref:exchange::to-publish-assets-maven.adoc[Publish and Deploy Exchange Assets Using Maven].
+
[NOTE]
Studio allows you to select only two project types when uploading an application to Exchange: `example` and `template`. To specify a different project type, publish your application using Maven.

== Configure the Runtime Fabric Deployment Strategy

Inside the `plugin` element, add a configuration for your Runtime Fabric deployment, replacing the following placeholder values with your Runtime Fabric information:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
    <runtimeFabricDeployment>
      <uri>https://anypoint.mulesoft.com</uri>
      <muleVersion>${app.runtime}</muleVersion>
      <username>${username}</username>
      <password>${password}</password>
      <applicationName>${runtime.fabric.application.name}</applicationName>
      <target>${runtime.fabric.name}</target>
      <environment>${environment}</environment>
      <provider>${provider}</provider>
      <properties>
        <key>value</key>
      </properties>
      <deploymentSettings>
        <publicUrl>${app.url}</publicUrl>
        <cpuReserved>500m</cpuReserved>
        <memoryReserved>800Mi</memoryReserved>
      </deploymentSettings>
    </runtimeFabricDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

== Deploy to Runtime Fabric

From the command line in your project's folder, package the application and execute the deploy goal:

[source,bash,linenums]
----
mvn clean package deploy -DmuleDeploy
----

== Redeploy to Runtime Fabric

To redeploy the application, run the same command as you did to deploy. +
Runtime Fabric rewrites the application you had deployed.

== Authentication Methods

include::4.2@partial$mmp-authentication.adoc[tags=!authenticationMethodsIntro;!authenticationCloudHub;!authenticationOnPrem]

For a detailed description of the configuration parameters, see the <<rtf-deploy-reference, Runtime Fabric Deployment Parameters Reference>>.
